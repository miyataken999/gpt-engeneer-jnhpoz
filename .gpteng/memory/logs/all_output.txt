================================ System Message ================================

You will get instructions for code to write.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
```
print("Hello World")
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Include module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
For Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.
For NodeJS, you always create an appropriate package.json file.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

Request: APIのテストケースサンプルですAPIのテストケースサンプルです

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Based on your request, I will create a Python API with Flask and implement test cases using Pytest.

Here is the implementation:

**Folder Structure**
```
api/
app/
__init__.py
app.py
models/
__init__.py
user.py
routes/
__init__.py
user.py
tests/
__init__.py
test_user.py
requirements.txt
```

**requirements.txt**
```
Flask==2.0.1
pytest==6.2.5
```

**app/__init__.py**
```
# empty file
```

**app/app.py**
```
from flask import Flask, jsonify
from routes.user import user_blueprint

app = Flask(__name__)
app.register_blueprint(user_blueprint)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Welcome to the API!'
```

**models/__init__.py**
```
# empty file
```

**models/user.py**
```
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class User:
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
```

**routes/__init__.py**
```
# empty file
```

**routes/user.py**
```
from flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify
from models.user import User

user_blueprint = Blueprint('user', __name__)

@user_blueprint.route('/users', methods=['GET'])
def get_users():
    users = [User(1, 'John Doe', 'john@example.com'), User(2, 'Jane Doe', 'jane@example.com')]
    return jsonify([user.__dict__ for user in users])

@user_blueprint.route('/users/<int:user_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_user(user_id):
    user = User(user_id, 'John Doe', 'john@example.com')
    return jsonify(user.__dict__)
```

**tests/__init__.py**
```
# empty file
```

**tests/test_user.py**
```
import pytest
from app import app

@pytest.fixture
def client():
    with app.test_client() as client:
        yield client

def test_get_users(client):
    response = client.get('/users')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert len(response.json) == 2

def test_get_user(client):
    response = client.get('/users/1')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json['id'] == 1
    assert response.json['name'] == 'John Doe'
    assert response.json['email'] == 'john@example.com'
```

This concludes a fully working implementation.
